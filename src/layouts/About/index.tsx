            I work as a freelance web developer in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam,
            I've also worked remotely with clients in Italy, Thailand,
            Australia, Japan, and other countries with a variety of projects
            including EC, corporate websites, high-load services, and portals...
            Iâ€™ve had over 8 years of experience creating high-quality web design
            and development. My engineering skills-set is dynamic and constantly
            evolves to match the most recent trends so I can refine my process
            to make the process of making a website easier for you. More than
            that, I can help you unlock the value of your idea and solve your
            development challenges by delivering best-in-class creative
            strategy, user experience, and visual design on a website that
            results in a solution that meets the needs of your business within
            budget and on time.
